  * nested rule creation can be disabled using a ruleset's "nested" attribute
  * ip gathering procedure now trims the subnet mask
  * negation of destination and source now possible using th "!" operator
  * dummy rules for a sample docker environment added
  * Proof of concept for a webinterface to visualize some iptables 
    statistics laterwards.
  * Adding attribute 'enabled' through xmlstarlet to mark rulesets 
    currently in use. Determined through the webinterface.  
  * Option 'down' now simply invokes a quit after reset.

  * xmlstarlet used instead xmllint as older versions of xmllint
    probably do not include the required '--xpath' option.
  * Reduction of unsupported grep options.
  * Removal of already processed paramaters when setting up rules
    to avoid running rulesets already set multiple times
